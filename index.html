				Insights about the data/visualization:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The data starts off with a narrow width. Other narrow widths, signifying a smaller amount of cases, occur around June 2020 and June 2021. Some of the peak cases occur around January 2021, September 2021, and January 2022. Note that these are local minimums and maximums.</li>
				<li>It looks like cases typically decreased throughout the summer, and cases generally oscillate in volume around the summers.</li>
				<li>I note the 7 day average, which from my understanding is the red line. Since the data is distributed across a calender timeline, I assume that the data was calculated at four points throughout the month. Otherwise, I assume that the data is selected as an average of the 7 days around the day in which the data point is calculated.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Critique:
				My first thought is that the choice to make the data a swirl was mesmerizing and forced the reader to further interpret what they were looking at. Some visualizations are easy to read and do not force the reader to think more critically about the patterns. After taking an initial look at the design, the design clearly starts at the center. Dates are clearly labeled. I think the visualization clearly shows that there are peaks and troughs in the number of cases throughout the seasons. It is not entirely clear how often the data points were calculated, and it is initially hard to understand the magnitude of the number of cases from the width metric chosen. After reading the article as well, it looks like the main problem is understanding just how many cases will occur in January 2022. The visualization makes it seem like there will be a large (scary) amount of cases in January 2022, but with the context of the article, it shares that analysts are actually not sure. The visualization makes readers think the omicron variant can become extremely prolific.

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 1:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>My first intuition was to make sure that we could clearly see the timeline across 2020 to 2022 </li>
				<li>I chose a simple line graph to depict the growth and reduction in cases over time.</li>
				<li>I also chose to make sure that the intervals on each of the axes were easily readable and spaced out.</li>
				<li>Additionally, I added a projected label for January 2022 so that readers know that at the time of the original design, these were suspected numbers.</li>

			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 2:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I wanted to depict the years of 2020 and 2021 above and below eachother so the readers can understand </li>
				<li>I also liked reducing the timeline and comparing 2020 and 2021 so that the reader can understand the general increase in cases over time, as well as observe the peaks and troughs.</li>
				<li></li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				Design Rationale for Sketch 3:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>I liked the idea of comparing 2020 and 2021, but I wanted to use a bar graph and select certain mnoths of the year in order to enable the reader to more effectively compare the peaks and troughs.</li>
				<li>I also wanted to use bar graphs so that the reader can effectively compare months throughout the year against 2020 and 2021, with a relevant legend.</li>
				<li>I think that this is also an opportunity to showcase projections for January 2022. Future iterations of this graph can include an estimated range of cases for January 2022.</li>

			<h2>Final Writeup</h2>

			<p>
        DESCRIBE YOUR RATIONALE TO JUSTIFY THE DECISIONS FOR YOUR FINAL DESIGN.
				WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO CONVEY, AND HOW DOES YOUR DESIGN FACILITATE THIS?
      </p>

			<p>
        REFLECT ON HOW YOUR FINAL DESIGN DOES OR DOES NOT ADDRESS YOUR ORIGINAL CRITIQUE.
				WHAT TENSIONS OR TRADEOFFS DID YOU ENCOUNTER? WHAT DID NOT WORK OUT AS ANTICIPATED?
